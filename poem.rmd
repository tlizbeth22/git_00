## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

A BOAT beneath a sunny sky,  
Lingering onward dreamily  
In an evening of July --  
Children three that nestle near,  
Eager eye and willing ear,  

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

The farmhouse lingers, though averse to square  
With the new city street it has to wear  
A number in. But what about the brook  
That held the house as in an elbow-crook?  
I ask as one who knew the brook, its strength  

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

"The sun was shining on the sea,  
      Shining with all his might:  

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
And sorry I could not travel both  
And be one traveler, long I stood  
And looked down one as far as I could  
To where it bent in the undergrowth;  

Then took the other, as just as fair,  
And having perhaps the better claim,  
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;  
Though as for that the passing there  
Had worn them really about the same,  

And both that morning equally lay  
In leaves no step had trodden black.  
Oh, I kept the first for another day!  
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,  
I doubted if I should ever come back.  

I shall be telling this with a sigh  
Somewhere ages and ages hence:  
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”  
I took the one less traveled by,  
And that has made all the difference.
